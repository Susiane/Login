The Android Login App contains a user authentication screen by email and password, a registration screen and a welcome screen. Firebase Authentication was used for user authentication and to register a new user, Firebase Realtime Database stores additional information related to the user. YouTube Android Player API makes it possible to display videos.
Some unit tests have been designed to make sure that form field validation is not changed and stay in accordance with established assumptions.
For the refinement of the interface was used custom views, CollapsingToolbarLayout and CardView.
